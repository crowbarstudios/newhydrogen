                <p class="text-base">BioSolar is developing breakthrough technologies to increase the storage capacity,
                    lower the cost and extend the life of lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. The need for such
                    breakthroughs is critical to meet the expected demand of the rapidly growing global electric vehicle
                    battery market, which is forecast to exceed $90 billion by 2025. A lithium-ion battery contains two
                    major parts, a lithium-filled cathode and a lithium-receiving anode, that function together as the
                    positive and negative sides of the battery. BioSolar is developing innovative technologies that will
                    enable the use of inexpensive silicon as the anode material to create next generation high energy
                    and high-power lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. Founded with the vision of developing
                    breakthrough energy technologies, BioSolar's previous successes include the world's first bio-based
                    backsheet for use in solar panels. <br><br> To learn more about BioSolar, please visit our website

                <h4 class="text-lg font-bold">About Newhydrogen, Inc.</h4>
                <p class="text-base">NewHydrogen is developing ThermoLoop™ – a breakthrough technology that uses water
                    and heat rather than electricity to produce the world’s lowest cost green hydrogen. Hydrogen is the
                    cleanest and most abundant element in the universe, and we can’t live without it. Hydrogen is the
                    key ingredient in making fertilizers needed to grow food for the world. It is also used for
                    transportation, refining oil and making steel, glass, pharmaceuticals and more. Nearly all the
                    hydrogen today is made from hydrocarbons like coal, oil, and natural gas, which are dirty and
                    limited resources. Water, on the other hand, is an infinite and renewable worldwide resource.
                    <br><br>
                    Currently, the most common method of making green hydrogen is to split water into oxygen and
                    hydrogen with an electrolyzer using green electricity produced from solar or wind. However, green
                    electricity is and always will be very expensive. It currently accounts for 73% of the cost of green
                    hydrogen. By using heat directly, we can skip the expensive process of making electricity, and
                    fundamentally lower the cost of green hydrogen. Inexpensive heat can be obtained from concentrated
                    solar, geothermal, nuclear reactors and industrial waste heat for use in our novel low-cost
                    thermochemical water splitting process. Working with a world class research team at UC Santa
                    Barbara, our goal is to help usher in the green hydrogen economy that Goldman Sachs estimated to
                    have a future market value of $12 trillion.
